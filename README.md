## But why?

I enjoy the visualization of interesting maths and physics concepts thanks to content creators such as [3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown), [TheCodingTrain](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain), [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/@SebastianLague), [Pezzza's Work](https://www.youtube.com/@PezzzasWork). I also use these projects to learn more about languages and frameworks I don't use in my day to day work such as [OpenFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/) with C++ and [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) with JS. 

## But how (do I use it)?

Depends on the project and framework used. If it was done with OpenFrameworks, the project is configured to work with VisualStudio.

### Dependencies

None for now.

### Running

Refer to each project's documentation.

## But what?

A lot of things! Here is a preview of the currently implemented projects:

#### [Julia Set Visualizer](https://github.com/danmohedano/math-vis/tree/main/julia-set)

![julia-21508](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43313293/222983215-17007b1e-0da5-4ced-869d-e6970071b535.png)

#### [Prime Race](https://github.com/danmohedano/math-vis/tree/main/prime-race)

![figure2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43313293/223521847-68134a6f-4832-4496-b2aa-c9e5c05ab35c.png)

## But how (does it work)?

Refer to each project's documentation.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Refactor the Fourier Transform drawing implementation.
- [ ] Prime spirals
- [ ] Dragon curve generation
- [ ] Polygon-generated fractals (i.e. Sierpiński triangle)

See the [open issues](https://github.com/danmohedano/math-vis/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues). 

## Contributing
