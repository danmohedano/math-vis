# Prime Race

When iterating through all the prime values, assign them to two groups depending on if the prime number $p$ fulfills $p \equiv 1 mod 4$ or $p \equiv 3 mod 4$. 

Surprisingly, the second group tends to receive more elements. For the first 100,000 prime numbers, the label for biggest group changes in several occasions. After that, the second group seems to achieve supremacy.
